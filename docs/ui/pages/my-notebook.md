# My Notebook

## 1. Page Overview

### Description
- Simple private workspace where authenticated users (anonymous and regular) can create and manage their personal collection of plain text notes.
- Designed with a responsive, mobile-first approach optimized for basic note taking.
- Features touch-friendly interactions and enhanced keyboard support for desktop.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for real-time interactivity and personalized experience.
- Dark mode only in phase 1 - no light mode theme switching available.

### URL
- `/me` (personal notebook dashboard)

### Access
- Authenticated users only (anonymous and regular).
- Anonymous user authentication via Firebase Auth happens automatically on first visit.
- Visiting this page without session triggers `signInAnonymously()` silently in background.
- **Database Operation**: Anonymous user data is automatically stored in DB upon first authentication.

## 2. Layout and Structure

This page is composed of the following components. For component details, see the **Storybook** and individual component specs.

### Primary Components

- `PrivateNoteCard` (individual note preview with hover actions and metadata)
- `FloatingActionButton` (quick create note button on mobile only)
- `NoteEditor` (inline text editor for creating/editing notes)

- Note cards show edit/delete actions on hover (desktop) or touch (mobile).
