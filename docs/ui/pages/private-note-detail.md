# Private Note Detail

## 1. Page Overview

### Description
- Dedicated page for viewing and editing individual private notes within the authenticated user's personal notebook.
- Designed with a responsive, mobile-first approach optimized for reading and in-place editing.
- Features touch-friendly interactions and enhanced keyboard support for desktop.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** for real-time interactivity and personalized experience.
- Dark mode only in phase 1 - no light mode theme switching available.

### URL
- `/me/notes/[id]` (e.g., `/me/notes/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)

### Access
- Authenticated users only (anonymous and regular).
- Users can only access their own private notes.
- Anonymous user authentication via Firebase Auth happens automatically if needed.
- **Database Operation**: Anonymous user data is automatically stored in DB upon first authentication.

## 2. Layout and Structure

This page is composed of the following components. For component details, see the **Storybook** and individual component specs.

### Primary Components
- `PageHeader` (navigation with back button and action buttons)
- `NoteHeader` (note title with visibility badge, creation/update dates, word count)
- `NoteContent` (plain text content with proper typography)
- `NoteEditor` (in-place text editor for editing mode)
- `ActionButtons` (edit, delete, save, cancel controls)
- `VisibilityBadge` (shows public/private status of the note)
- `CommentSection` (displays existing comments and comment form for authenticated users)
- `CommentForm` (allows authenticated users to post new comments)
- `CommentList` (displays all comments with username and content)

### Responsive Behavior
- The layout is mobile-first with optimal reading width constraints.
- On screens 768px and wider (the `md` breakpoint), content is centered with comfortable reading margins.
- Header provides contextual navigation back to notebook.
- Edit/delete controls are easily accessible but positioned to prevent accidental activation.

## 5. State & Visibility Rules

Describe how the page's appearance or behavior changes based on application state or data fetching.

### Authentication State
- Anonymous user authentication happens automatically if user is not authenticated.
  - **Database Operation**: Anonymous user data is stored in DB during first authentication
- All features are available immediately after authentication and database storage completes.
- Page shows authentication retry option if authentication fails.

### Loading State
- During initial auth and note fetch, shows loading spinner with back navigation.
- Edit/delete actions show loading indicators during API operations.
- Save operation shows loading state on save button.

### Edit Mode State
- In edit mode, note content is replaced with editable form fields.
- Edit/delete buttons are hidden, replaced with save/cancel buttons.
- Form validation prevents saving empty content.

### Empty State
- If note content is empty, shows placeholder text in view mode.
- Edit mode always shows editable fields regardless of content state.

### Error State
- Authentication failures show error message with retry option.
- Note not found (404) redirects to Next.js 404 page.
- API errors during CRUD operations display error messages with retry options.
- Network connectivity issues show offline indicator.

### Comment State
- **Loading Comments**: Shows loading indicator while fetching comments.
- **Empty Comments**: Shows "No comments yet" message when no comments exist.
- **Comment Form**: Only visible to authenticated users (anonymous or regular).
- **Unauthenticated**: Shows "Sign in to post comments" message instead of form.
- **Comment Submission**: Shows loading state on submit button during API call.
- **Comment Error**: Displays error message if comment submission fails.
- **WebSocket Connection**: Shows connection status indicator (connected/disconnected).
- **Real-time Updates**: New comments appear instantly without page refresh via WebSocket.

### Success State
- Successful note updates show brief "Saved" confirmation.
- Successful deletion shows confirmation before navigation.
- Successful comment posting immediately adds comment to list.
- Smooth transitions between view and edit modes.

### Responsiveness State
- Mobile: Single column layout with stacked action buttons and full-width comment form.
- Tablet/Desktop: Wider content area with inline action buttons and optimized comment layout.
- Touch-friendly tap targets on mobile devices.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions on desktop.

## 6. Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Users can only access notes that belong to their authenticated session.
- Firebase Auth token validates user identity on every API request.
- No client-side note ID enumeration or unauthorized access possible.

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks in note content and comments.
- Content length limits prevent abuse and performance issues.
- Title, content, and comment validation on both client and server sides.
- Comment content limited to reasonable character count (e.g., 1000 characters).

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Note data is cached using TanStack Query for instant navigation.
- Cache invalidation on successful updates maintains data consistency.
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback during saves.

### Loading Optimization
- Lazy loading of edit components until edit mode is activated.
- Comment section loads independently of note content for better perceived performance.
- Efficient re-rendering only affected components during state changes.
- Minimal API calls through intelligent cache management.
- Real-time comment updates without full page refresh.
