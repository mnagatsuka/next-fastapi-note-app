# Login & SignUp Modals

## 1. Page Overview

### Description
- Global authentication modals that can be triggered from any page to allow users to upgrade from anonymous to regular accounts or authenticate existing regular accounts.
- Designed with a responsive, mobile-first approach optimized for conversion and accessibility.
- Features touch-friendly interactions and enhanced keyboard support for desktop.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** with modal overlay behavior.
- Dark mode only in phase 1 - no light mode theme switching available.

### URL
- No direct URL - triggered as modals with state management
- Modal state can be reflected in URL query parameters for deep linking (e.g., `/?auth=signup`)

### Access
- Available to all users (anonymous and unauthenticated).
- Primary use case: converting anonymous users to regular accounts.
- Secondary use case: regular user authentication for returning users.

## 2. Layout and Structure

These modals are composed of the following components. For component details, see the **Storybook** and individual component specs.

### Login Modal Components
- `ModalOverlay` (backdrop with click-to-dismiss and focus trap)
